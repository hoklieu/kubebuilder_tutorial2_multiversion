1. how to test the first one
first undeploy any running images in local kind cluster
    you can first k get pods to see what are running
    then run this:
        make undeploy IMG=asong51689/tutorial1:<version>

2. make any changes, then build and push image:
    make docker-build docker-push IMG=asong51689/tutorial1:<tag>

3. deploy everything (rbacs, roles, deployment, service, configmap, wbconfiguration, cert-manager, etc):
    make deploy IMG=asong51689/tutorial1:<version>

how to verify:
in one terminal, follow the logs of the controller pod

in the other, deploy something valid/invalid and check logs (search for "validate" to check webhook logs.)

the latest running image for tutorial 1:
make deploy IMG=asong51689/tutorial1:0.0.6
